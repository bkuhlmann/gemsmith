## Screencasts

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/173862.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/173862)

## Requirements

0. A UNIX-based system.
0. [Ruby 2.5.x](https://www.ruby-lang.org).
0. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org).
0. [Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler).

## Setup

### Install

Type the following to install:

    gem install gemsmith

### Configuration

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

    ~/.config/gemsmith/configuration.yml

It can also be configured via [XDG environment variables](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/runcom#xdg)
as provided by the [Runcom](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/runcom) gem. Check out the [Runcom
Examples](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/runcom#examples) for project specific usage.

The default configuration is as follows:

    :year: <current year>
    :github_user: "<Git config GitHub user>",
    :gem:
      :label: "Undefined"
      :name: "undefined"
      :path: "undefined"
      :class: "Undefined"
      :platform: "Gem::Platform::RUBY"
      :url: "https://github.com/<author>/<gem name>"
      :license: "MIT"
    :author:
      :name: "<Git config user name>"
      :email: "<Git config user email>"
      :url: ""
    :organization:
      :name: ""
      :url: ""
    :versions:
      :ruby: "<current Ruby version>"
      :rails: "5.1"
    :generate:
      :bundler_audit: true
      :circle_ci: false
      :cli: false
      :code_climate: false
      :engine: false
      :git_cop: true
      :git_hub: true
      :guard: true
      :pry: true
      :reek: true
      :rspec: true
      :rubocop: true
      :security: false
    :publish:
      :sign: false

Feel free to take this default configuration, modify, and save as your own custom
`configuration.yml`.

### Existing Gems

If you have gems that were not originally crafted by Gemsmith, you can add Gemsmith support to them
by modifying the following files:

Add the following to your gem's `*.gemspec` file:

    spec.add_development_dependency "gemsmith"

Replace or add a modified version of the following to your gem's `Rakefile`:

    # frozen_string_literal: true

    begin
      require "gemsmith/rake/setup"
    rescue LoadError => error
      puts error.message
    end

*NOTE: Ensure `require "bundler/gem_tasks"` is removed as Gemsmith replaces Bundler functionality.*

With those changes, you can leverage the benefits of Gemsmith within your existing gem.

### Rake

Once a gem skeleton has been created, the following tasks are available (i.e. `bundle exec rake
-T`):

    rake build                 # Build example-0.1.0.gem package
    rake bundle:audit          # Updates the ruby-advisory-db then runs bundle-audit
    rake clean                 # Clean gem artifacts
    rake code_quality          # Run code quality checks
    rake git_cop               # Run Git Cop
    rake install               # Install example-0.1.0.gem package
    rake publish               # Build, tag as 0.1.0 (unsigned), and push example-0.1.0.gem to RubyGems
    rake reek                  # Check for code smells
    rake rubocop               # Run RuboCop
    rake rubocop:auto_correct  # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses
    rake spec                  # Run RSpec code examples
    rake toc                   # Update Table of Contents (README)

*NOTE: Some tasks might differ depending on what options you enabled/disabled during gem
generation.*

When building/testing your gem locally, a typical workflow is:

0. `bundle exec rake install`
0. Test your gem locally.
0. Repeat until satisfied.

When satified with your gem, builds are green, and ready to publish, run:

    bundle exec rake publish

## Tests

To test, run:

    bundle exec rake

## Security

### Git Signing Key

To securely sign your Git tags, install and configure [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org):

    brew install gpg
    gpg --gen-key

When creating your GPG key, choose these settings:

- Key kind: RSA and RSA (default)
- Key size: 4096
- Key validity: 0
- Real Name: `<your name>`
- Email: `<your email>`
- Passphrase: `<your passphrase>`

To obtain your key, run the following and take the part after the forward slash:

    gpg --list-keys | grep pub

Add your key to your global Git configuration in the `[user]` section. Example:

    [user]
      signingkey = <your GPG key>

Now, when publishing your gems with Gemsmith (i.e. `bundle exec rake publish`), signing of your Git
tag will happen automatically. You will be prompted for the GPG Passphrase each time but that is to
be expected.

### Gem Certificates

To create a certificate for your gems, run the following:

    cd ~/.ssh
    gem cert --build you@example.com
    chmod 600 gem-*.pem

The resulting `*.pem` key files can be referenced via the `:private_key:` and `:public_key:` keys
within the `~/.gemsmithrc` file.

To learn more about gem certificates, read the following:

- [RubyGems](http://guides.rubygems.org/security/#building_gems)
- [A Practical Guide to Using Signed Ruby Gems - Part 1: Bundler](http://blog.meldium.com/home/2013/3/3/signed-rubygems-part)
- [A Practical Guide to Using Signed Ruby Gems - Part 2: Heroku](http://blog.meldium.com/home/2013/3/6/signed-gems-on-heroku)

## Private Gem Servers

By default, the following Rake task will publish your gem to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org):

    bundle exec rake publish

You can change this behavior by adding metadata to your gemspec that will allow the Rake tasks,
mentioned above, to publish your gem to an alternate/private gem server instead. This can be done by
updating your gem specification and RubyGems credentials.

### Gem Specification Metadata

Add the following metadata to your gemspec:

    Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
      spec.metadata = {
        "allowed_push_key" => "example_key",
        "allowed_push_host" => "https://gems.example.com"
      }
    end

The gemspec metadata keys and values *must* be strings per the
[RubyGems Specification](http://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/#metadata). Each key
represents the following:

- `allowed_push_key`: Provides a reference (look up) to the key defined the RubyGems credentials
  file so that sensitive credentials are not used within your gemspec.
- `allowed_push_host`: Provides the URL of the private gem server to push your gem to.

### Gem Credentials

With your gem specification metadata established, you are ready to publish your gem to a public or
private server. If this is your first time publishing a gem and no gem credentials have been
configured, you'll be prompted for them. Gem credentials are stored in the RubyGems
`~/.gem/credentials` file. From this point forward, future gem publishing will use your stored
credentials instead. Multiple credentials can be stored in the `~/.gem/credentials` file. Example:

    ---
    :rubygems_api_key: 2a0b460650e67d9b85a60e183defa376
    :example_key: "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA=="

Should you need to delete a credential (due to a bad login/password for example), you can open the
`~/.gem/credentials` in your default editor and remove the line(s) you don't need. Upon next publish
of your gem, you'll be prompted for the missing credentials.

## Promotion

Once your gem is released, you might want to let the world know about your accomplishment:

- [How to Spread the Word About Your Code](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/how-to-spread-the-word-about-your-code)
- [RubyFlow](http://www.rubyflow.com)
- [Ruby on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/)
- [Ruby Mailing List](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists/)
- [Ruby Devs Slack](https://rubydevs.herokuapp.com/)
- [Ruby Community](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/)

## Troubleshooting

When running `bundle exec rake install` or `bundle exec rake publish` with modified, staged, or
uncommitted Git changes, the rake task will throw an error to this effect. When this occurs, it is
recommended that you commit your changes or [stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) them before
proceeding.

## Versioning

Read [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) for details. Briefly, it means:
