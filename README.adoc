=== Rake

Once a gem skeleton has been created, the following tasks are available (i.e. `bundle exec rake
-T`):

....
rake build                 # Build example-0.1.0.gem package
rake bundle:audit          # Updates the ruby-advisory-db then runs bundle-audit
rake clean                 # Clean gem artifacts
rake code_quality          # Run code quality checks
rake git_cop               # Run Git Cop
rake install               # Install example-0.1.0.gem package
rake publish               # Build, tag as 0.1.0 (unsigned), and push example-0.1.0.gem to RubyGems
rake reek                  # Check for code smells
rake rubocop               # Run RuboCop
rake rubocop:auto_correct  # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses
rake spec                  # Run RSpec code examples
rake toc                   # Update Table of Contents (README)
....

_NOTE: Some tasks might differ depending on what options you enabled/disabled during gem
generation._

When building/testing your gem locally, a typical workflow is:

. `bundle exec rake install`
. Test your gem locally.
. Repeat until satisfied.

When satified with your gem, builds are green, and ready to publish, run:

....
bundle exec rake publish
....

=== Configuration

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
$HOME/.config/gemsmith/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment variables.

The default configuration is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
:year: <current year>
:github_user: "<Git config GitHub user>"
:gem:
  :label: "Undefined"
  :name: "undefined"
  :path: "undefined"
  :class: "Undefined"
  :platform: "Gem::Platform::RUBY"
  :url: "https://github.com/<author>/<gem name>"
  :license: "MIT"
:author:
  :name: "<Git config user name>"
  :email: "<Git config user email>"
  :url: ""
:organization:
  :name: ""
  :url: ""
:versions:
  :ruby: "<current Ruby version>"
  :rails: "5.1"
:generate:
  :bundler_audit: true
  :circle_ci: false
  :cli: false
  :engine: false
  :git_cop: true
  :git_hub: true
  :guard: true
  :pry: true
  :reek: true
  :rspec: true
  :rubocop: true
  :simple_cov: true
  :security: false
:publish:
  :sign: false
----

Feel free to take this default configuration, modify, and save as your own custom
`configuration.yml`.

=== Existing Gems

If you have gems that were not originally crafted by Gemsmith, you can add Gemsmith support to them
by modifying the following files:

Add the following to your gem's `.gemspec` file:

[source,ruby]
----
spec.add_development_dependency "gemsmith"
----

Replace or add a modified version of the following to your gem's `Rakefile`:

[source,ruby]
----
# frozen_string_literal: true

begin
  require "gemsmith/rake/setup"
rescue LoadError => error
  puts error.message
end
----

_NOTE: Ensure `require "bundler/gem_tasks"` is removed as Gemsmith replaces Bundler functionality._

With those changes, you can leverage the benefits of Gemsmith within your existing gem.

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake
----

== Security

=== Git Signing Key

To securely sign your Git tags, install and configure link:https://www.gnupg.org[GPG]:

[source,bash]
----
brew install gpg
gpg --gen-key
----

When creating your GPG key, choose these settings:

* Key kind: RSA and RSA (default)
* Key size: 4096
* Key validity: 0
* Real Name: `<your name>`
* Email: `<your email>`
* Passphrase: `<your passphrase>`

To obtain your key, run the following and take the part after the forward slash:

[source,bash]
----
gpg --list-keys | grep pub
----

Add your key to your global Git configuration in the `[user]` section. Example:

....
[user]
  signingkey = <your GPG key>
....

Now, when publishing your gems with Gemsmith (i.e. `bundle exec rake publish`), signing of your Git
tag will happen automatically. You will be prompted for the GPG Passphrase each time but that is to
be expected.

=== Gem Certificates

To create a certificate for your gems, run the following:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/.ssh
gem cert --build you@example.com
chmod 600 gem-*.pem
----

The resulting `.pem` key files can be referenced via the `:private_key:` and `:public_key:` keys
within the `$HOME/.gemsmithrc` file.

To learn more about gem certificates, read about RubyGems
link:https://guides.rubygems.org/security[Security].

== Private Gem Servers

By default, the following Rake task will publish your gem to link:https://rubygems.org[RubyGems]:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake publish
----

You can change this behavior by adding metadata to your gemspec that will allow the Rake tasks,
mentioned above, to publish your gem to an alternate/private gem server instead. This can be done by
updating your gem specification and RubyGems credentials.

=== Gem Specification Metadata

Add the following metadata to your gemspec:

[source,ruby]
----
Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
  spec.metadata = {
    "allowed_push_key" => "example_key",
    "allowed_push_host" => "https://gems.example.com"
  }
end
----

The gemspec metadata keys and values _must_ be strings per the
link:https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/#metadata[RubyGems Specification]. Each key
represents the following:

* `allowed_push_key`: Provides a reference (look up) to the key defined the RubyGems credentials
  file so that sensitive credentials are not used within your gemspec.
* `allowed_push_host`: Provides the URL of the private gem server to push your gem to.

=== Gem Credentials

With your gem specification metadata established, you are ready to publish your gem to a public or
private server. If this is your first time publishing a gem and no gem credentials have been
configured, you'll be prompted for them. Gem credentials are stored in the RubyGems
`$HOME/.gem/credentials` file. From this point forward, future gem publishing will use your stored
credentials instead. Multiple credentials can be stored in the `$HOME/.gem/credentials` file.
Example:

[source,yaml]
----
:rubygems_api_key: 2a0b460650e67d9b85a60e183defa376
:example_key: "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA=="
----

Should you need to delete a credential (due to a bad login/password for example), you can open the
`$HOME/.gem/credentials` in your default editor and remove the line(s) you don't need. Upon next
publish of your gem, you'll be prompted for the missing credentials.

== Promotion

Once your gem is released, let the world know about your accomplishment by posting an update to
these sites:

* link:http://www.rubyflow.com[RubyFlow]
* link:https://ruby.libhunt.com[Ruby Library Hunt]
* link:http://rubydaily.org[RubyDaily]
* link:https://awesome-ruby.com[Awesome Ruby]
* link:https://www.ruby-toolbox.com[Ruby Toolbox]
* link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community[Ruby Community]

== Troubleshooting

When running `bundle exec rake install` or `bundle exec rake publish` with modified, staged, or
uncommitted Git changes, the rake task will throw an error to this effect. When this occurs, it is
recommended that you commit your changes or link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash[stash] them
before proceeding.

== Versioning

Read link:https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning] for details. Briefly, it means:

* Major (X.y.z) - Incremented for any backwards incompatible public API changes.
* Minor (x.Y.z) - Incremented for new, backwards compatible, public API enhancements/fixes.
* Patch (x.y.Z) - Incremented for small, backwards compatible, bug fixes.
